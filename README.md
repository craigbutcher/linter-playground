# Linter playground

This is a work in progress repository for running different file types (JS, TS, Go, Rust, etc.) through a linter to flag programming errors.

It started while I was rewriting neovim configuration (as you do) and was experimenting with different linters to see how errors are flagged. I didn't want to manually write a lot of example files, so I used ChatGPT to quickly generated them instead.

As a side quest, try fixing the errors to see how the linters respond.
